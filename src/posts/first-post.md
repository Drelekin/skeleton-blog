Check your load functions: If you're using load functions in your routes, make sure they're not throwing any errors. If a load function throws an error, SvelteKit will return a 500 error, but this could potentially cause a 404 error depending on your setup. ðŸ‘‹

```ts
function greet(name: string) {
	console.log(`Hey ${name}! ðŸ‘‹`);
}
```
